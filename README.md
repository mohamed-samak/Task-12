# Task-12.2
Select_Motors

1-Movement Motors are selected by omar ahmed
the motor selcted is **Brushless** DC motors 

# **BLDC Advantages**:
High Efficiency: Because the motor has no brushes, internal friction is much lower, increasing energy efficiency.

Longer Lifespan: The lack of brushes means there are fewer parts to wear out over time, increasing the life of the motor.

Higher Speed: BLDC motors can reach higher rotational speeds than conventional DC motors.

Precise Control: The speed and torque of the motor can be better controlled using electronic control technology, making it suitable for applications that require precision control such as drones or electric cars.

* This Advantages will help us to control the movment because we will need a high speed and high control

2- Dribbling Motors selected by Mahmoud Sameh

The selected motor is **Servo Motor**

servo motor would be a suitable solution for this task

## Advantages:

### 1-Precision Control:
Servo motors provide precise control over position, speed, and torque. This can be beneficial in maintaining accurate control over ball movement and providing smooth changes in direction.

### 2-Closed-Loop Feedback:
Servos use a feedback mechanism, which allows them to maintain a specific position or adjust dynamically to changes. Where this will be important for real-time ball dribbling, where continuous adjustments are made.

### 3-Dynamic Response:
Depending on the size and power of the servo, you can get a change in speed and direction rapidly, which is essential for controlling the ball's movement effectively.

### 4-Simple Control:
Servo motors are easier to control compared to stepper motors, as they use PWM signals to command the position and speed. For basic dribbling applications where position control is critical, they can work well.


### The most prefered type of servo motor is the **continuous rotation**, this type does not have a limit on i

3-Shooting and Passing selected by mohamed yasser
In robocoon 2025, the robots are asked to play a basket ball match of two.
The dimensions of the field are 15m,8m and the height of the basket is 2.5m.
so we need a roobot that can launch the ball more than 2.5m in air.
The ball will be thrown and it will follow the projectile motion principles so the characteristics:
1. high speed for high altidue and wide range.
2. high positional control for controling the angle at which the ball is being projected for either shooting or passing.
3. high speed control for  intial speed variation.
it is very hard to provide a motor that have all this characteristics without costing alot of money so the most appropriate solution is to design a mechanical arm and a hand at the end of it with two different types of motor.
for the motor that is responsible for holding the arm we need to provide with high tourqe.
we can use a servo motor for that as it provides:-
1. High dynamics
2. Great positioning accuracy
3. Low weight
4. Feedback control
5. High efficiency
6. Power density
but one of its disadvantages that it provides tourqe at the cost of the speed (high tourqe and low speed) so to get a high speed servo motor it will cost alot of money and will have ultra high tourqe which will be wasted in this application.

for the motor that is responsible for holding the hand we need to provide with low tourqe and high speed.
we can use a brushed dc motor for that as it provides:-
1. high speed to low torque which is approprite for the light hand not for the heavy arm
2. low cost for high speed (we can use a BLDC motor but it will be much more expensive)
3. Good speed control using PWM
But it does not have a good positional control as servo motor or stepper
 
DC motor links:-

https://m.alibaba.com/x/AxT9EF?ck=pdp

so by combining this two motors we can make a catapult like arm which can shoot the ball with great speed by moving the two motors and can pass the ball with approprite speed and to the right position with the servo motor.
Having a cost of :- 300-400 EP
