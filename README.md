# Task-12.2
select motors

2- Dribbling Motors selected by Mahmoud Sameh

The selected motor is **Servo Motor**

servo motor would be a suitable solution for this task

## Advantages:

### 1-Precision Control:
Servo motors provide precise control over position, speed, and torque. This can be beneficial in maintaining accurate control over ball movement and providing smooth changes in direction.

### 2-Closed-Loop Feedback:
Servos use a feedback mechanism, which allows them to maintain a specific position or adjust dynamically to changes. Where this will be important for real-time ball dribbling, where continuous adjustments are made.

### 3-Dynamic Response:
Depending on the size and power of the servo, you can get a change in speed and direction rapidly, which is essential for controlling the ball's movement effectively.

### 4-Simple Control:
Servo motors are easier to control compared to stepper motors, as they use PWM signals to command the position and speed. For basic dribbling applications where position control is critical, they can work well.


### The most prefered type of servo motor is the **continuous rotation**, this type does not have a limit on its range of motion. The limitless motion of these motors enables them to move in both CW, and CCW directions, which will be needed for continuous adjustments to control the ball
